Foxy allows you to validate and manage the assets (javascript, stylesheet, etc.) of PHP libraries
during the installation of Composer dependencies with all permitted features
by [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) with the `package.json` file
in your PHP project and PHP libraries.

#### Fast

Foxy retrieves the list of all Composer dependencies to inject the asset dependencies in the file `package.json`,
and leaves the execution of the analysis, validation and downloading of the libraries to NPM or Yarn. Therefore,
no VCS Repository of Composer is used for analyzing the asset dependencies, and you keep the performances
of each package manager.

#### Reliable

Foxy uses the lock file of Composer, as well as NPM or Yarn lock files.

#### Secure

Foxy restores the Composer lock file as well as any PHP dependencies if NPM or Yarn ends with an error.
